# garfield bot @garfieldpicture
A simple Python script that publishes a random Garfield strip to Twitter.

This was my first success with making a Twitter bot. It's overall very straightforward. The code picks a random date in a specified range. Then, assuming you have some hypothetical database of Garfield comic strips, it uses the date information to simply grab the specified strip. It also uses the date information to concatenate the text that will be published alongside the photo. 

At first, this bot was web-based, meaning the database lived online. However, with the acquisition of Paws Inc. by Viacom, the bot changed gears.

To view this bot in action, go to twitter.com/garfieldpicture.
